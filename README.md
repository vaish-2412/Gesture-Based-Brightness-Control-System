# Gesture-Based-Brightness-Control-System
Developed a real-time system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to control screen brightness through hand gestures. It detects the distance between thumb and index finger to adjust brightness dynamically. Integrated computer vision techniques with hardware-level brightness control to demonstrate an intuitive, contactless interactionÂ system.
